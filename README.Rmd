{restatis} is a wrapper around the RESTful API that provides access to data from the [Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis)](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of {restatis} from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("long39ng/restatis")
```

## Usage

To use most functionality of the package, you need to have an account at https://www-genesis.destatis.de and store your username and password using `set_login_data()`.^[{restatis} relies on the [keyring package](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring) to store and access credentials on your computer.] You can run `login_check()` to see if you can access the API with the saved credentials.
